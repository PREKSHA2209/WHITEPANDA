                                           As the assignment is to design the CAR RENTAL AGENCY .As I designed all the required frontend part of the project .But in the assignment it mentioned that to display current booking details of customer and enter the customer details into database but this needs database for execution  so we have to execute backend part to display the details from database and book the car.And booking button to be available or unavialable based on the number of cars we have..again this also we need backend part to execute.Moreover my system doesnot contain php servers for execution of backend part of the assignment. So  I have all the frontend which is required and in place of submit or register button I have changed it to url to move to new page.
                                           <br/>

                                           <br/>SO PLEASE CONSIDER THE FRONTEND PART OF THE ASSIGNMENT.
